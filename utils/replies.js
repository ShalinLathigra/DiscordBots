    Greetings intrepid heroes!\n\
    You must complete a most dangerous quest to restore glory to the once-mighty Kingdom of Aerin, you must reclaim the Nugget of Power from the dark forest & return it to the grand city of Tirion!\n\n\
    We have put forth our bravest and brightest led by the great wizard Merlin, but keep your wits sharp. The vile Archvillain Redneck Gamemaster has sent his minions and his most trusted Assassin to interfere. We suspect there are {0} minions in the party aiding the Assassin\n\
    They will be doing their best to poison your party from the inside, if they manage to cause three quests to fail, or if they manage to stall through five proposals for a quest, then they win.\n\
    If the pure of heart prevail and successfully defeat three trials, then the Assassin will have one chance to assassinate Merlin, snatching the goblet and plunging Aerin into chaos once more.\n\n\
    Best of luck oh brave and mighty few, all of our fates rest on your shoulders.\n\
